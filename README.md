# 10.3.3-Drivers-test

## Todo: 

Plese do item 1-4 on your own. I will go thought the next part with you. 
1. Load a logo for a driver's school
2. Add variables for age and testScore
3. use window prompt to ask users for their age
4. if their age is able 16, they can do the test, else if above 14 learners... else .... hit the road jack.
5. Put in the test answers
    - use `key === '3'` to check if the last key they pressed was "3"  Remember the "" for all of these

```
// Drivers Test
//Global Variables
let logo;
//2)
//

function preload(){
  // logo = createImg("");
}//end preloading of images and fonts

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 400);
  background(100,92,80);
// 3) 

}//end setup
function draw() {
    background(255,0,0);
    image(logo, 50,50,100,100);

    textSize(18);
    fill(255, 255, 0);

  // 4) Logic for if statements 
    // if(){
    //     text("You are eligible for your full license." , 50, 200,);
    // } else if (){
    //     text("You are eligible for your Learner's license." , 50, 200,);
    // } else {
    //     text("You are not eligible. Beat it loser.", 50, 200);
    // }// end 

 
    text("Your current score: " + testScore, 200, 380);
    text("How many colors are there on a traffic light?", 50, 250);
    text("Which color is in the middle of a traffic light? (type r, g or y)", 50, 275);
    text("On what side of the road do they drive in Australia? (use the arrow keys)", 50, 300);
    text("Are kangaroos eligible for driver tests? (type m for yes, or n for no)", 50, 325);

}//end draw

function keyPressed() {
  //5) answering the questions
    if(){
        testScore++;
    } else if (){ // set to y
        testScore++;
